Despite the name, this is  e-commerce api.

sing aspnet minimal api

this is a very simplified project.

the main focus is for me to learn minimal api and how to use it.


This is focusing about doing the basic, adding a form of authorization, and basic CRUD operations for products.

it will not be focused on being a true true e-commerce, just something for me to learn.


Features.

get product.

add products, update products, delete products. (Auth, only admins)
